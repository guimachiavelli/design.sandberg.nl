Such statements are called true contradictions, or dialetheia.</p><p>The 2014 Graduates of Sandberg Instituut's Design Department confront the dilemmas of our disoriented times. Witnessing and accelerating the deterioration of formal rules and systems, they have a tendency to point out contradictions. They are willing and wanting to embrace incongruity as reality, and as a condition for new possibilities.</p><p>Forward-thinking, risk-taking critical optimists, the graduates reflect on the present with a sense of clarity and an alternative perspective. They narrate, enact and embody the polemic tendencies of society today. They challenge alleged truths and dominant systems, those so engrained as to become invisible. Dialetheism is emerging as a mode of thinking and of being.</p>",
