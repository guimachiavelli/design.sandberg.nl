* the design department's website would work mostly as a student showcase;
* there will be no content besides student content -- all institutional
  information (tutors, department's aims and methodology, etc) will be in
  the main sandberg.nl site;
* the content will be scraped (be it through APIs, direct database
  connection or regular web scraping techniques) so we can avoid students
  uploading the same content twice (e.g., once for sandberg.nl and once
  for the department's website);
* it will be visually simple and, more importantly, disconnected from any
  graduation show or etc;
* we will aim towards a first, basic version for the graduation show. this
  version will probably only draw content from sandberg.nl;
* on the next school year, we will see what other sources might be
  relevant to add to each student's profile;
* initially we will only add the most recent students, as we have readily
  available data for them. older students will instead only have their
  names with a link to their website.
